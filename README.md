# local-food-vendor
In a bustling area outside the MIT old New campus, a vibrant community of local food vendors caters to the diverse tastes of students and passersby. However, the lack of a standardized platform has left these hidden gems largely undiscovered. To bridge this gap, we propose the development of a user-friendly website that serves as a comprehensive directory for these local vendors.

Problem Statement:

Absence of a centralized platform for local food vendors.
Lack of information on menus, prices, and discounts.
Difficulty for students and visitors in discovering suitable dining options.
Project Goal:

Our goal is to create a simple and effective web solution that enables users to explore, compare, and connect with local food vendors effortlessly. The website will provide detailed information about each vendor, including their menu, pricing, discounts, and contact details, empowering users to make informed dining choices.

Key Features:

Vendor Listings:
A curated list of local food vendors with distinct profiles.
Each profile includes the vendor's name, a showcase of photos, and contact information.
Menu Display:
A dedicated section for each vendor's menu, allowing users to view available dishes and their prices.
Discount Information:
Clear visibility of any ongoing discounts or special offers provided by the vendors.
User Interaction:
Contact details (phone number) for each vendor to facilitate inquiries and orders.
